    "description": "After playing around with fishing in the expedition I realized how painful it was to release multiple fishes with the inventory closing everytime you released one, so I made this mod for myself to use and uploading it for anyone else that also is annoyed by it, the mod basically makes it not close the inventory when you release a fish.\n<br />\n<br />Before uploading I looked around and found that someone had already done this mod before, it was [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/brehny/mods]brehny[/url]﻿, but their mod was outdated and still using the old method with PAKs that the game doesn't use anymore, after contacting them, they said they were out of the NMS loop and that I was allowed to upload my mod.\n<br />[size=2]They also made their own mod hidden hence why I can't link it here as credit for making it first.[/size][size=1]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=5][url=https://antifandom.com/nomanssky/wiki/Mods#Installing_Mods][color=#ffff00]Click Here for Instructions of how to Install Mods[/color][/url][/size][/b]",

If XenonSurf ever resurfaces and objects to this mod, I'll remove it. I'll eventually post a Lua again, but at present, I'm hand editing the EXML from diffs I make from my NMSMB builds.\n<br />\n<br />Now that that's out of the way, this is Better Base Sites.  If you buy/trade for a Planetary Chart for a Secure Site of Interest (the top option in trading with the Cartographer), it now has a chance of locating a Habitable (or Planetary) Base.  This base site is a large flat area with a base computer installed in the center.  Just walk up to it and claim the site.  The mod also adds a waypoint to the site.\n<br />\n<br />✅ Updated for Worlds Part II\n<br />✅ Patch mod - likely to work well with other Patch and Overwrite mods\n<br />\n<br />Contains the following files: \n<br />[code]&#92;METADATA&#92;REALITY&#92;TABLES&#92;REWARDTABLE.EXML\n<br />&#92;METADATA&#92;SIMULATION&#92;ENVIRONMENT&#92;PLANETBUILDINGTABLE.EXML\n<br />&#92;METADATA&#92;SIMULATION&#92;SCANNING&#92;SCANEVENTTABLEPLANET.EXML\n<br />[/code]",
